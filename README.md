# Twitch.tv-Status-Viewer
FFC Intermediate Front End Development Project

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

  User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

  User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

  User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
